# DATA201-Assignments
This Repository contains my responses to assignments 3-6 from DATA201 in Trimester 2 of 2021. If you are currently in DATA201 or plan to take the course in the future, please do not look at the files, as you will be breaching the university's rules on plagiarism.

The jupyter notebooks uploaded here are the files submitted for assignments 3-6. I have not included assignments 1 and 2 as they were tests of very basic concepts required for machine learning, and these skills were better expressed in the following four assignments. As you progress through the files, you will see that many of the techniques are brought together to gain greater understanding of the skills used in machine learning. This leads into assignment 6, which was the final project of the course.

When running these jupyter notebooks, make sure to have the appropriate .csv files in the same folder so that the data can be used in the notebook. These files are as follows:
 - Assignment 3: fmnist_small.csv (contained in fmnist_small.zip)
 - Assignment 4: data.csv
 - Assignment 5: no files required, as this uses an dataset build in to jupyter notebooks
 - Assignment 6: train.csv and test.csv
